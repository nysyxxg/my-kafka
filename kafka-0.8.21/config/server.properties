############################# Server Basics #############################

# The id of the broker. This must be set to a unique integer for each broker.
broker.id=0

############################# Socket Server Settings #############################

# The port the socket server listens on
port=9092

# Hostname the broker will bind to. If not set, the server will bind to all interfaces
#host.name=localhost

# Hostname the broker will advertise to producers and consumers. If not set, it uses the
# value for "host.name" if configured.  Otherwise, it will use the value returned from
# java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName().
#advertised.host.name=<hostname routable by clients>

# The port to publish to ZooKeeper for clients to use. If this is not set,
# it will publish the same port that the broker binds to.
#advertised.port=<port accessible by clients>

# The number of threads handling network requests
num.network.threads=3
 
# The number of threads doing disk I/O
num.io.threads=8

# The send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) used by the socket server
socket.send.buffer.bytes=102400

# The receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) used by the socket server
socket.receive.buffer.bytes=102400

# The maximum size of a request that the socket server will accept (protection against OOM)
socket.request.max.bytes=104857600


############################# Log Basics #############################

# A comma seperated list of directories under which to store log files
log.dirs=D://my-kafka//kafka-0821//kafka-logs

# The default number of log partitions per topic. More partitions allow greater
# parallelism for consumption, but this will also result in more files across
# the brokers.
num.partitions=1

#具体的副本数量由参数offsets.topic.replication.factor指定
#topic的offset的备份份数。建议设置更高的数字保证更高的可用性
offsets.topic.replication.factor=1

#默认备份份数，仅指自动创建的topics
default.replication.factor=1

# The number of threads per data directory to be used for log recovery at startup and flushing at shutdown.
# This value is recommended to be increased for installations with data dirs located in RAID array.
num.recovery.threads.per.data.dir=1

############################# Log Flush Policy #############################

# Messages are immediately written to the filesystem but by default we only fsync() to sync
# the OS cache lazily. The following configurations control the flush of data to disk. 
# There are a few important trade-offs here:
#    1. Durability: Unflushed data may be lost if you are not using replication.
#    2. Latency: Very large flush intervals may lead to latency spikes when the flush does occur as there will be a lot of data to flush.
#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation, and a small flush interval may lead to exceessive seeks. 
# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or
# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.

# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk
#log.flush.interval.messages=10000

# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush
#log.flush.interval.ms=1000

############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can
# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.
# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens
# from the end of the log.

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion
#日志保留时间长度
#基于时间的日志删除策略
log.retention.hours=168
#log.retention.minutes=5
#log.retention.ms=5

# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log as long as the remaining
# segments don't drop below log.retention.bytes.
#log.retention.bytes=1073741824
#最大日志保留大小
#基于日志大小的保留策略
log.retention.bytes=1073741824
# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.

#设置分段segment文件的大小，超过这个大小，就会生成一个新的文件
log.segment.bytes=1073741824

# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according 
# to the retention policies
## 定时检查周期，发现数据存了超过上面配置的时间，默认5分钟，就会执行上面配置的删除策略
log.retention.check.interval.ms=300000

# By default the log cleaner is disabled and the log retention policy will default to just delete segments after their retention expires.
# If log.cleaner.enable=true is set the cleaner will be enabled and individual logs can then be marked for log compaction.
#log.cleaner.enable=false
#log.cleaner.enable=true
log.segment.delete.delay.ms=1000
#过期数据删除策略，最重要的配置 
log.cleaner.enable=true
log.cleanup.policy=delete
#以上配置只对默认配置，属于全局配置，并不一定对全部topic起效


############################# Zookeeper #############################

# Zookeeper connection string (see zookeeper docs for details).
# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the
# root directory for all kafka znodes.
zookeeper.connect=127.0.0.1:2181
#zookeeper.connect=hadoopserver00:2181,hadoopserver02:2181,hadoopserver11:2181,hadoopserver12:2181,hadoopserver13:2181

# Timeout in ms for connecting to zookeeper
zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=6000
