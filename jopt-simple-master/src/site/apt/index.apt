                      JOpt Simple
                      -----------

    JOpt Simple is a Java library for parsing command line options, such as those you
    might pass to an invocation of <<<javac>>>.

    In the interest of striving for simplicity, as closely as possible JOpt Simple
    attempts to honor the command line option syntaxes of
    {{{http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap12.html} POSIX <<<getopt()>>>}}
    and
    GNU {{{http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt-Long-Options.html} <<<getopt_long()>>>}}.
    It also aims to make option parser configuration and retrieval of options and their
    arguments simple and expressive, without being overly clever.

    Here are some libraries that perform the same duties as JOpt Simple:

    * {{{http://jargs.sourceforge.net} JArgs}}

    * {{{http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/cli/} Jakarta Commons CLI}}

    * {{{http://te-code.sourceforge.net/} TE-Code}} has a command line parsing library.

    * {{{http://www.cs.ubc.ca/spider/lloyd/java/argparser.html} argparser}}

    * {{{http://www.urbanophile.com/arenn/hacking/download.html} Java port of GNU getopt}}

    * {{{https://args4j.dev.java.net/} Args4J}}

    * {{{http://www.martiansoftware.com/jsap/} JSAP}}

    * {{{http://clajr.sourceforge.net} CLAJR}}

    * {{{http://ostermiller.org/utils/CmdLn.html} CmdLn}}

    * {{{http://jewelcli.sourceforge.net} JewelCli}}

    * {{{http://jcommando.sourceforge.net} JCommando}}

    * {{{http://code.google.com/p/parse-cmd/} parse-cmd}}

    * {{{http://jcommander.org} JCommander}}

    I hope you'll agree that JOpt Simple tops them all in ease of use and cleanliness of
    code (although I admire JewelCli quite a bit).

    I'd love to hear your constructive {{{mailto:pholser@alumni.rice.edu} feedback}},
    especially suggestions for improvements to the library or the site!  If your project
    is using JOpt Simple, do let me know.

    From {{{http://weblogs.java.net/blog/mreinhold/} Mark Reinhold}}: "I thought you might
    be interested to know that we're using your jopt-simple library in the open-source
    Java Development Kit.  Thanks for writing such a nice little library!  It's far
    cleaner than any of the other alternatives out there."
